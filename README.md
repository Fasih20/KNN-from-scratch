# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier from Scratch

This project implements a simple K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier from scratch without using `sklearn`. The model is trained on the famous Iris dataset.

## Features
- Implements KNN without external machine learning libraries.
- Uses Euclidean distance for classification.
- Works with the Iris dataset.

## Files
- `KNN_No_Library.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation.

## How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells to train and test the model.
3. Modify `k` values to experiment with different numbers of neighbors.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook
